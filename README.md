## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? Our motivation was to build a presentable and working anime website to enhance the user video experience and make anime fun and interactive. Gone are the days of dull and boring anime websites, introducting Anime4You a new extravagant anime website.
- Why did you build this project? We built this project to challenge ourselves and understand how to utilize different elements and how to incorporate them, building a masterpeice that works well in conjunction with each webpage and division within the website.
- What problem does it solve? Problem it solves is it displays a working and stable anime website to make anime easy to search for, and a learning experience to those new to anime.
- What did you learn? We learned different HTML, CSS, and Java Script styling elements and how to use them, but also learned how use different variables and proper inputs of arrays.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. First we had to write the code from scratch, building the HTML and About Us page and worked on elements to get them to apply properly, then we had to build the CSS and make sure the styling elements were working hand in hand to the HTML. Then we had to write the java code, making sure the internal components worked well together with the other pieces of information. Then lastly we had to write the readme file and fill it out.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
